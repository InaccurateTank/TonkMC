Various Minecraft computer mod code pieces.

OpenComputers
* **GUI.lua:** Homebrewed GUI API.  Vastly inferior to basically everything else that exists.  Mainly a learning project.
* **crawl.lua** Filesystem manager built with the GUI API.  Fully funtional barring remaking the terminal commands.
* **tera.lua** IC2 Fluid Reactor controller.  Built with GUI
* **ttif.lua** TankTech Image Format.  AKA shitty table files for storing complex pixel data.

ComputerCraft
* **GUI-R.lua:** ""Redux"" of the OpenComputers GUI API.  Built for CC: Tweaked.
